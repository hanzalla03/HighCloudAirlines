✈️ High Cloud Airlines Data Analysis Project
📊 Project Overview
The High Cloud Airlines project is a comprehensive data analysis initiative aimed at uncovering insights into airline operations, customer behavior, and performance metrics. The project integrates multiple tools—Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau—to perform end-to-end data analysis, from preprocessing and querying to dashboard visualization.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python: Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL: Data extraction, querying, and preparation (used with MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server)

Excel: Initial data exploration, pivot tables, and basic summary analysis

Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation and KPI tracking

Tableau: Visual storytelling and advanced data visualization
